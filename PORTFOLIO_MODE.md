# ðŸŽ¯ PORTFOLIO-OPTIMIZED RUNTIME SCHEDULER

## ðŸ“± Portfolio Mode Configuration

Set these environment variables in Railway for **minimal resource usage:**

### **Demo Hours Only (2 hours/day):**
```bash
TIMEZONE=US/Eastern
RUNTIME_START_HOUR=12      # 12 PM
RUNTIME_END_HOUR=14        # 2 PM
```
**Result:** Only 2 hours/day = ~60 hours/month (WELL within free tier)

### **Interview Hours (Business hours only):**
```bash
TIMEZONE=US/Eastern
RUNTIME_START_HOUR=9       # 9 AM
RUNTIME_END_HOUR=17        # 5 PM
```
**Result:** 8 hours/day = ~240 hours/month

### **Weekdays Only Mode:**
```bash
TIMEZONE=US/Eastern
RUNTIME_START_HOUR=9
RUNTIME_END_HOUR=17
RUNTIME_WEEKDAYS_ONLY=true  # New feature I'll add
